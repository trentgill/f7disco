@par Example Description

This projects provides a reference template that can be used to build any firmware application.

This projects is configured for STM32F769xx devices using STM32CubeF7 HAL and running on 
STM32F769I-DISCO board from STMicroelectronics.

This template provides two workspaces:
 - STM32F769I_DISCOVERY(AXIM-FLASH): using the Flash AXIM interface (Cache & MPU features)
 - STM32F769I_DISCOVERY(ITCM-FLASH): using the Flash ITCM interface (ART Accelerator)
 
The template includes also two functions used to configure MPU feature and to enable the CPU Cache,
respectively MPU_Config() and CPU_CACHE_Enable().
These functions are provided as template implementation that User may integrate in his application, 
to enhance the performance in case of use of AXI interface with several masters.

@note Some code parts can be executed in the ITCM-RAM (16 KB) which decrease critical task execution time, compared  
      to code execution from Flash memory. This feature can be activated using '#pragma location = ".itcmram"' to be 
      placed above function declaration, or using the toolchain GUI (file options) to execute a whole source file in
	  the ITCM-RAM.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application needs to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Keywords

Reference, Template, MPU, CPU Cache

@Note  If the user code size exceeds the DTCM-RAM size or starts from internal cacheable memories (SRAM1 and SRAM2),
       it is recommended to configure the latters as Write Through.
       This is ensured by configuring the memory attributes at MPU level in order to ensure cache coherence on SRAM1 and SRAM2.
       Please, refer to Template project for a typical MPU configuration.

@Note  If external memory is shared between several processors, it is recommended to configure it as Write Back (bufferable), shareable and cacheable.
       The memory base address and size must be properly updated.
       The user needs to manage the cache coherence at application level.

For more details about the MPU configuration and use, please refer to AN4838 “Managing memory protection unit (MPU) in STM32 MCUs”

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F767xx/STM32F769xx/STM32F777xx/STM32F779xx devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32769I-DISCO
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example

In order to load the Flash_ITCM configuration, you must follow the instructions below :
- Open EWARM/SW4STM32 toolchain
- Rebuild all files
- Open STM32 ST-Link Utility V3.9.0
- Connect the STM32F769I-Discovery board to PC with USB cable through CN16
- Use the corresponding hex file with ST-Link Utility to program ITCM Flash :
  - EWARM: "Project.hex"
  - SW4STM32: "STM32F769I_DISCOVERY(ITCM-FLASH).hex"
